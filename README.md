# Statistics-Project
The aim of this project was to predict that a particular location is rice crop land or a non rice crop land with the help of satellite data(both radar and optical).

This project is the level 1 part of EY Open Science Data Challenge 2023. All the training dataset was provided by EY team. The satellite data was taken from Microsoft Planetary computer which is an open source medium for researchers and acedemics to study the earth with the help of satellite data and make satellite data more accessible to the world.
